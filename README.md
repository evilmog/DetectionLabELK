* 55GB+ of free disk space
* 16GB+ of RAM
* Vagrant 2.2.2 or newer
* Virtualbox



## Deployment Options
1.  **Use Vagrant Cloud Boxes - ETA ~2 hours**.
    * [Install Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) on your system.
    * [Install Packer](https://packer.io/downloads.html) on your system.
    * Install the Vagrant-Reload plugin by running the following command: `vagrant plugin install vagrant-reload`.
    * Download DetectionLabELK to your local machine by running `git clone https://github.com/cyberdefenders/DetectionLabELK.git` from command line OR download it directly via [this link](https://github.com/cyberdefenders/DetectionLabELK/archive/master.zip).
    * `cd` to "DetectionLabELK/Vagrant" and execute `vagrant up`.

2.  **Build Boxes From Scratch - ETA ~5 hours**. 
    * [Install Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) on your system.
    * [Install Packer](https://packer.io/downloads.html) on your system.
    * Install "Vagrant-Reload" plugin by running the following command: `vagrant plugin install vagrant-reload`.
    * Download DetectionLabELK to your local machine by running `git clone https://github.com/cyberdefenders/DetectionLabELK.git` from command line OR download it directly via [this link](https://github.com/cyberdefenders/DetectionLabELK/archive/master.zip).
    * `cd` to "DetectionLabELK" base directory and build the lab by executing `./build.sh virtualbox` (Mac & Linux) or `./build.ps1 virtualbox` (Windows).
    
    
## Troubleshooting:    
* To verify that building process completed successfully, ensure you are in `DetectionLabELK/Vagrant` directory and run `vagrant status`. The four machines (wef,dc,logger and win10) should be running. if one of the machines was not running, execute `vagrant reload <host>`. If you would like to pause the whole lab, execute `vagrant suspend` and resume it using `vagrant resume`.
* Deployment logs will be present in the `Vagrant` folder as `vagrant_up_<host>.log`
